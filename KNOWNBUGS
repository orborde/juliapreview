(FIXED) juliapreview.c:draw_julia and/or draw_mandelbrot:
	SDL_UpdateRects is being passed an argument of 0 for number of 
	rectangles to update. This should logically be 1, but it appears that
	bugs in SDL currently make this otherwise. Check these bits if it stops
	working with future SDL versions.
	FIX: Oops. No, the errors I was getting were in the mandelbrot screen
		dimensions/coords. Wheeeee.
